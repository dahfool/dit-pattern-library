# Provisional Road map
1. Add Legacy Header and Footer back to the library - https://trello.com/c/N4foauWo/15-add-header-and-footer-to-new-patterns-library
2. Add pre-compile assets to GPL package (works around envronment restrictions preventing on-the-fly build/compilation on GDS PAAS) - https://trello.com/c/HNIX19Qh/6-add-compiled-assets-to-the-gpl-package
3. Update typography - https://trello.com/c/NZPglQ1n/14-font-styles-library-update
4. Trial adding new library to an existing live project (provisionally ExOpps) - https://trello.com/c/AbbPdXNc/16-spike-replace-old-pattern-library-with-new-pattern-library-for-export-opportunities
5. Review whether new pattern library is ready to roll out to more services
